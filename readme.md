# FRC - 2021 - The Swerve Strikes Back

## Todo List
- [x] Command Based Structure
- [ ] Add Swerve Control Code
  - [ ] 4 Wheel Modules
  - [ ] Arbitrary Wheel Counts
  - [ ] Driver Station UI
- [ ] Shooter Code
- [ ] Climb Code
- [ ] Target Tracking

## How do I download this code Mr. Dylan of the past?
Well child, download git, open up the command line and enter this command!
```bash
git clone https://github.com/QuillDev/FRC-2021.git
```
Then open the file then do this cool stuff (it makes you look cool)
```bash
cd FRC-2021
code .
```
It will open VSCode (hopefully the one with WPILib installed)
If that didn't open in the FRC 20XX Version (whatever the current year is) of vscode
then just manually open it in vscode by doing:
> (File->Open Folder->X:/XXXX/FRC-2021)

Good luck person of the future!
